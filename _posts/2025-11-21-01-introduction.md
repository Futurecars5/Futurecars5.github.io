# 01. Introduction: The Biggest Automotive Revolution in History (2025–2045)

From 2025 to 2045, the car will change more than in the previous 140 years combined.

By 2035 **99 % of new cars sold globally** will be fully electric.  
By 2045 **70 % of all vehicles on the road** will drive themselves.

These are not guesses — they are locked into EU law, Tesla/Waymo roadmaps, and trillions already invested.

### Three forces that collided
- Battery cost: $1,200/kWh → **$58/kWh** → heading to $30  
- AI drives 10× safer than humans  
- $1.7 trillion in subsidies and ICE bans

### By 2030 you’ll see
- Family sedans: 600 km range + 300 km in 8 minutes  
- Robotaxis in 100 cities at $0.30/km  
- Cars that update overnight like an iPhone

### 2045 reality
- No steering wheel, pedals, or mirrors  
- Roads charge you while driving  
- Cities without parking lots — only parks
