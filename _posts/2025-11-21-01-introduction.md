# 01. Introduction: The Biggest Automotive Revolution in History (2025–2045)

Imagine this: you buy a brand-new car in 2024. By 2032 it already looks as ridiculous as a BlackBerry in 2015.  
That’s not sci-fi. From 2025 to 2045 the automobile is going to evolve more than it did in the entire 140 years since Karl Benz first scared the horses.

By 2035 — **99 % of new cars sold worldwide** will be fully electric.  
By 2045 — **70 % of all vehicles on the road** will drive themselves.  

These numbers aren’t wishes. They’re already baked into EU law, Chinese industrial policy, Tesla/Waymo/Cruise deployment plans, and roughly **$7 trillion** of capital that’s already been committed and can’t be called back.

### Three tectonic plates just collided at once

1. **Batteries went from gold to dirt**  
   2010 → $1,200/kWh  
   2024 → $58/kWh (CATL, real shipping price)  
   2028–2030 → $30–35/kWh  
   When storing electrons becomes cheaper than pumping dead dinosaurs, physics wins.

2. **AI already drives 10× safer than you**  
   Waymo alone: 50+ million autonomous miles, basically one contested fatality.  
   Humans: one fatality every ~100 million miles.  
   Actuaries have already placed their bets.

3. **Politicians and money pressed the accelerator**  
   Hard ICE sales bans locked in law (EU 2035, China pushing even earlier in big cities, California, Norway, UK…).  
   $1.7 trillion in direct subsidies + another $5–6 trillion in batteries, factories, and grids that are already under construction.

### What normal life looks like by 2030 (yes, really 2030)

- A $35–40k family car with 600+ km real range and +300 km in 8–10 minutes of charging.  
- Robotaxis in 100+ cities costing $0.30–0.40 per km — cheaper than owning the car you have right now.  
- Your car gets new features while you sleep, like your phone used to.

### 2045 — the car as you know it is gone

- No wheel, no pedals, no mirrors, often no windshield wipers (lidar laughs at rain).  
- Roads that charge the car while you roll (live pilots in Sweden, Italy, Indiana right now).  
- City-center parking lots turned into actual parks, cafés, and apartments.  
- “Finding parking” will sound as archaic as “dial-up internet tone.”

In 2045 your kids will look at photos of a 2025 car and ask:  
“Wait… people steered these themselves? And paid every week to feed it liquid explosives?”

Get ready. Soon the only thing you’ll have to buckle is your seatbelt nostalgia.
