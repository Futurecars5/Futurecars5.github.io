Picture this: you drive off the lot in a brand-new 2024 car. By 2032 it already looks as outdated as a BlackBerry in 2015. 😏  
This isn’t sci-fi. From 2025 to 2045, the automobile will evolve more than it did in the entire 140 years since Karl Benz first spooked the horses.

By 2035 — **99 % of new cars sold globally** will be fully electric.  
By 2045 — **70 % of all vehicles on the road** will drive themselves.

These aren’t hopes or hype. They’re locked in: EU legislation, Chinese industrial policy, Tesla/Waymo/Cruise roadmaps, and roughly **$7 trillion** in capital already committed and irreversible.

### Three tectonic forces just slammed together

1. **Batteries went from priceless to dirt-cheap** ⚡  
   2010 → $1,200 per kWh  
   2024 → $58/kWh (CATL’s actual shipping price)  
   2028–2030 → $30–35/kWh  
   When storing electrons costs less than pumping dead dinosaurs, physics takes the wheel.

2. **AI already drives 10× safer than humans** 🤖  
   Waymo alone: 50+ million autonomous miles, essentially one contested fatality.  
   Humans: one fatality roughly every 100 million miles.  
   Insurance actuaries have already placed their money — not on us.

3. **Policy and capital floored the accelerator** 💰  
   Hard ICE sales bans are law (EU 2035, China even earlier in megacities, California, Norway, UK…).  
   $1.7 trillion in direct subsidies + another $5–6 trillion already flowing into batteries, factories, and grids under construction right now.

### What everyday life looks like by 2030 — yes, really 2030

- A $35–40k family car with 600+ km real-world range and +300 km added in 8–10 minutes of charging.  
- Robotaxis in 100+ cities at $0.30–0.40 per km — cheaper than owning the car you drive today.  
- Your car wakes up smarter every morning with new features overnight, just like your phone used to.

### 2045 — the car as you know it ceases to exist

- No steering wheel, no pedals, no mirrors, often no wipers (lidars don’t care about rain).  
- Roads that charge your car as you drive (live pilots already running in Sweden, Italy, Indiana).  
- Downtown parking lots reborn as parks, cafés, apartments.  
- “Looking for parking” will sound as ancient as “waiting for dial-up to connect.”

In 2045 your kids will see a photo of a 2025 car and ask:  
“Wait… people actually steered these things themselves? And paid every week to feed them liquid explosives?”

Buckle up. Soon the only thing left to fasten will be your nostalgia.
