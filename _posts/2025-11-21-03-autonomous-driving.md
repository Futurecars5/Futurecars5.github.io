# 03. Autonomous Driving: From Level 2 to Level 5 in 20 Years (2025–2045)

By **2030**, **10 % of all new cars sold** will have Level 4 capability in defined areas.  
By **2045**, **zero human-driven vehicles** will be allowed inside any major city worldwide.  
Road deaths drop from **1.35 million/year today** → **under 10,000 globally** — safer than staying at home.

Waymo already drives **50,000 paid rides per week** with no driver (2024 data).
