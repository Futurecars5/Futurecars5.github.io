description: "By 2030 robotaxis operate in 100 cities. By 2045 human driving is banned in every major city and road deaths are essentially zero."

Right now, in late 2025, Waymo is already delivering **over 50,000 paid, fully driverless rides every week** in Phoenix, SF, LA, and Austin.  
Zero fatalities across more than 50 million autonomous miles.  
Humans? We manage to kill someone roughly every 100 million miles.

The verdict is harsh: the robot is already safer than you. 🤖  
And it’s just warming up.

By **2030** → commercial driverless robotaxis roll 24/7 in at least **100 cities** worldwide.  
By **2045** → you won’t be legally allowed to drive yourself inside any major city on the planet.  
Global road deaths drop from **1.35 million a year today** to under **10,000** — statistically safer than staying home on the couch.

### The timeline that’s already funded, permitted, and locked in

| Year | What actually launches                            | Who’s shipping it                          | Lives saved per year (cumulative) |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 2025 | Unlimited Level 3 on highways (eyes-off)         | Mercedes, BMW, Tesla (supervised)           | –                                 |
| 2026 | First Level 4 fleets over 1,000 vehicles         | Waymo, Baidu, WeRide                        | –                                 |
| 2028 | Unsupervised Level 4 on all highways globally    | Tesla FSD v14+, Waymo                       | ~50,000                           |
| 2030 | 100+ cities with round-the-clock robotaxis       | Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Apollo, Motional       | ~250,000                          |
| 2033 | First production Level 5 (no steering wheel)     | Tesla Cybercab, Xiaomi, Neo X               | –                                 |
| 2038 | >50 % of new cars sold are factory Level 5       | Nearly every major brand                    | ~900,000                          |
| 2045 | Human driving banned in cities                   | EU, China, California, Singapore, Japan…    | ~1.3 million                      |

This isn’t hype from a keynote deck.  
These are insurance filings, city contracts, factory orders, and laws already passed.

### Why the robot wins — and wins fast

- Human reaction time: 0.2–1 second (and that’s before coffee).  
  Robot: **0.0001 second** — and it never drinks, never scrolls, never gets road rage.

- **94 %** of today’s crashes are caused by human error.  
  Level 5 simply deletes the human from the equation.

- Waymo in 2025 is already **6.8× safer** per mile than the average American driver.  
  Tesla’s latest FSD data points in the same direction.

By 2045 your “car” will be safer than your sofa, cheaper than public transit, and faster door-to-door than anything with a human at the controls.

Your grandkids will watch old chase scenes in movies and ask:  
“Wait… the good guy is steering it himself? Why didn’t the car just drive better?”
