# 05. Charging Revolution: 6-Minute Full Charge and Roads That Charge You (2025–2045)

By **2030** the average new EV will charge **0–80 % in under 9 minutes**.  
By **2045** most owners will never visit a charging station — roads, parking lots and garages will charge automatically.

This is already in production.

### The real timeline (already funded & built)

| Year | Milestone                                  | Speed / Tech                         |
|------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2025 | 350 kW standard (Porsche, Hyundai, Xiaomi) | 400 km in 6–8 min                    |
| 2027 | 500–600 kW commercial stations             | 400 km in 4–5 min                    |
| 2029 | 1 MW chargers (first 1,000 stations)       | 800 km pack in 8 min                 |
| 2032 | Solid-state batteries 3C charging          | 0–100 % in 6 min                     |
| 2035 | 100,000+ inductive pads in parking lots   | 11–22 kW while parked                |
| 2040 | First dynamic wireless charging highways   | 200 kW while driving 120 km/h        |
| 2045 | 70 % of charging is wireless (road/parking)| You never plug in again              |

### Real projects live today
- Sweden: 2025 – first permanent electrified road (200 kW dynamic)
- Italy: A35 Brebemi – 2025 pilot 1 MW static + dynamic
- China: 2024 – 1,000 km of solar + inductive roads planned
- Israel: Electreon – 2024 buses charge while driving

### Numbers that kill gas stations
- 2024 best: 350 kW → 18 min for 400 km  
- 2030 average: 600 kW → 5 min for 400 km  
- 2045 wireless: 200 kW while driving → unlimited range in city

In 2045 “low battery” will sound as archaic as “out of film” does today.
