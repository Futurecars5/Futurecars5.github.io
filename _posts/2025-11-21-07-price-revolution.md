The old complaint “EVs are too expensive” died quietly in 2023… and stayed dead. 💀

By **2030** you’ll walk into a showroom and drive out in a brand-new, highway-ready electric car for **under $10,000** — with AC, 350 km range, and a 10-year battery warranty.  
By **2045** summoning a pristine robotaxi will cost just **$0.07–0.12 per km** — five to ten times cheaper than owning, fueling, insuring, and parking your own car.

This isn’t wishful thinking.  
It’s already reality in multiple cities today.

### Why owning your own car becomes financial madness

- Your private car sits idle **96 %** of its life. A robotaxi works **60–70 %** of the day.  
- One robotaxi replaces **8–12** private cars on the road.  
- You pay zero for insurance, parking, cleaning, charging stations, or midnight repairs.  
- In Hangzhou and Wuhan today, robotaxis are already **cheaper than the city bus**.

By 2045 city car ownership will feel like owning a horse in 1920: totally legal, insanely expensive, and a bit quirky.

Everyone else will just tap an app, hop in, and pay **7–9 cents per kilometer** while reading, working, or catching a nap.

Personal cars won’t vanish entirely.  
They’ll just become weekend toys — kept far from the city, like horses today.
