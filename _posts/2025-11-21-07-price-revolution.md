The era of “EVs are expensive” ended in 2023 and never came back.

By **2030** you will be able to buy a brand-new, highway-capable electric car for **under $10,000** — with air-conditioning, 350 km range, and a 10-year battery warranty.  
By **2045** summoning a spotless robotaxi will cost **$0.07–0.12 per km** — five to ten times cheaper than owning, fueling, insuring, and parking the car yourself.

This is not a prediction. It’s already cheaper in several cities today.

### Why personal car ownership becomes financial suicide

- Your private car sits parked **96 %** of its life. A robotaxi drives **60–70 %** of the day.  
- One robotaxi replaces **8–12** private cars in city traffic.  
- Passenger pays nothing for insurance, parking, cleaning, charging infrastructure, or 3 a.m. maintenance.  
- In Hangzhou and Wuhan in 2024 robotaxis are already **cheaper than the city bus**.

In 2045 owning a car in a city will feel like owning a horse in 1920 — perfectly legal, extremely expensive, and a little eccentric.

Everyone else will just tap an app and pay **7–9 cents per kilometer** while reading, working, or napping.

Personal cars won’t disappear completely.  
They’ll just become what horses are today: fun on weekends, somewhere far from the city.
