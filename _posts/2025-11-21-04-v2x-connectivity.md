By **2030** every new car in Europe, China and California will have C-V2X hardware by law.  
By **2045** traffic lights and stop signs will be museum exhibits.

V2X = Vehicle-to-Everything:
- V2V — cars talk to each other
- V2I — cars talk to roads and traffic lights
- V2C — cars talk to the cloud in real time

### Real numbers
- NHTSA: V2X can prevent **80 %** of non-impaired crashes
- China already has **over 10,000 km** of V2X roads (2024)
- One connected intersection saves **250,000 liters of fuel per year**

In 2045 your car will know the traffic light is turning green **before you even see it**.
