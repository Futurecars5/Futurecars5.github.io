# 06. Battery Revolution: From Lithium to Sodium and Solid-State (2025–2045)

By **2030** the average battery pack will cost **under $5,000**.  
By **2045** most new cars will use **sodium-ion or solid-state** batteries that last 3 million km and cannot catch fire.

This is already in mass production.

### The real roadmap (all factories already under construction)

| Year | Chemistry               | Cost $/kWh | Lifetime cycles | Energy density | Safety          |
|------|-------------------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2025 | LFP + semi-solid        | $65        | 65         | 4,000+          | 260 Wh/kg      | Very high       |
| 2027 | CATL/BYD sodium-ion     | $50        | 6,000+          | 180 Wh/kg      | Impossible fire |
| 2029 | First solid-state pilot | $80        | 1,200           | 400+ Wh/kg     | 100 % safe      |
| 2032 | Solid-state mass market | $55        | 2,000+          | 500 Wh/kg      | No liquid       |
| 2038 | Sodium + graphene       | $25        | 10,000          | 250 Wh/kg      | 30-year life    |
| 2045 | Ambient + solid polymer | <$20       | 20,000          | 600 Wh/kg      | Charges from air|

### Already happening today
- CATL: 2025 – sodium-ion in Chery and JAC cars  
- BYD: 2026 – Blade 2.0 with 5,000 cycles  
- Toyota: 2027–2028 – solid-state 1,200 km range, 10-minute charge  
- QuantumScape: 2025 – VW pilot line, no dendrite, no fire  
- Samsung SDI: 2027 – fully solid-state 600 Wh/kg

### The numbers that end the debate
- 2024 best LFP: 3,500 cycles  
- 2032 solid-state: 2,000+ cycles at 100 % DoD  
- Sodium-ion: works from –40 °C to +70 °C  
- Solid-state: physically cannot burn (no liquid electrolyte)

In 2045 a battery will outlive the car twice — and will be recycled into the next one with 97 % material recovery.
