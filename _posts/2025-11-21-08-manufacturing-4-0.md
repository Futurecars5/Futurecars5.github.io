# 08. Manufacturing 4.0: Gigacasting, Unboxed Process and 10-Hour Car (2025–2045)

By **2030** the average car will consist of **under 100 structural parts** instead of 1,700 today.  
By **2045** a complete car will roll off the line **every 40 seconds** — built in under **10 hours total**.

Tesla already does it.

### The real revolution (already in production)

| Year | Technology                      | Parts reduction | Build time   | Factory example             |
|------|----------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 2024 | Front + rear gigacasting         | –70 %           | 40 % faster  | Tesla Shanghai, Texas       |
| 2026 | Full underbody one piece         | –90 %           | –50 %        | Tesla Unboxed Process       |
| 2028 | Structural battery pack as floor | –95 %           | 12 hours     | Volvo, VW ID.2              |
| 2032 | 100 % gigacast body + doors      | 12 parts        | 6–8 hours    | Xiaomi, Xpeng               |
| 2038 | Full single-piece body           | 1 part          | 3 hours      | Next-gen Tesla/BYD          |
| 2045 | 10-hour car (including paint)    | <50 parts total | 40 sec/car   | Global standard             |

### Already live numbers
- Tesla Model Y: 70 % fewer moving parts than Model 3 (2020 → 2024)
- One 9,000-ton Giga Press replaces 70 robots and 300 welds
- Xiaomi SU7 factory: 76 seconds per car (2024)
- VW ID.2 platform: 30 % cheaper thanks to 900 fewer parts

### Why it kills traditional carmakers
- 40–50 % lower CAPEX per factory
- 10× fewer robots and workers
- No body shop → 60 % less factory footprint
- Impossible to retrofit old plants

In 2045 building a car will be closer to injection-molding a phone case than traditional automotive assembly.
