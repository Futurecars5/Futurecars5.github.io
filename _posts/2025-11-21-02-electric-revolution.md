# 02. Electric Revolution: The Day Gasoline Lost Forever (2025–2045)

Gasoline didn’t die screaming about the environment.  
It died quietly in an Excel sheet when the cost per mile of electricity fell below the cost of refined dead dinosaurs—and then kept falling.

By **2030** → **70 % of all new cars sold on planet Earth** will be 100 % battery electric.  
By **2045** → the internal-combustion engine will be legally extinct in every market that matters (EU, UK, Norway, California, New York, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and most of coastal China). The rest of the world will follow because no one builds two separate car lines forever.

This is no longer “policy ambition.” The laws are passed, the factories are built, the supply contracts are signed.

### The battery cost avalanche (already in motion)

| Year   | Price per kWh (pack level) | What it unlocks in the real world                                      |
|-------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2024  | ~$130                      | Decent 400–500 km EVs for $35–40k                                              |
| 2026  | **$70**                    | Full-size sedans and trucks under $30k, profit margins flip positive           |
| 2029  | **$45**                    | 1–1.6 million km battery warranties become normal, cheaper to keep than repair |
| 2035  | **$25**                    | The battery pack costs less than the steel body it’s bolted to                 |
| 2045  | **<$20**                   | Solar paint, structural batteries, ambient energy harvesting become mainstream |

### Why gasoline actually lost

- **Cheaper**: In Norway today electricity already costs 1/6th per km. By 2030 even in oil-rich Texas an EV will be half the fuel cost.
- **Faster**: 800-volt architectures already deliver 350 kW → 10 minutes = 400+ km. Megawatt charging (1.5–2 MW) is coming 2027–2028.
- **More convenient**: No more gas-station stops. You “refuel” at home, at work, at the supermarket—while doing something else.
- **Silent, smoother, zero maintenance** (no oil, no gearbox, no exhaust, no turbo lag).

The crazy part? Most people still think this is a “green” story.  
It’s not. It’s an economic execution. The environment just gets to celebrate the corpse.

The revolution is already over.  
We’re only waiting for the last neon “OPEN” sign at the corner gas station to flicker off forever.
