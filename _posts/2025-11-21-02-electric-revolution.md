Gasoline didn’t die in protests or with dramatic speeches about the climate.  
It died silently, in a boring Excel spreadsheet—when the cost per mile on electricity dropped below refined dinosaur juice… and then kept plummeting. 💀

By **2030** → **70 % of every new car sold on Earth** is 100 % battery electric.  
By **2045** → the internal combustion engine is legally extinct in every market that actually matters: EU, UK, Norway, California, New York, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and most of coastal China. The rest of the planet will follow because nobody is going to keep two separate assembly lines running forever.

This isn’t “hope” or “policy ambition” anymore.  
The laws are signed. The factories are built. The multi-decade supply contracts are locked. It’s over.

### The battery price avalanche — watch it happen in real time

| Year   | Pack price/kWh | What actually unlocks this year                                      |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2024  | ~$130          | Solid 500 km EVs for $35–40k                                                  |
| 2026  | **$70**        | Full-size trucks and sedans under $30k, carmakers finally make real profit   |
| 2029  | **$45**        | 1–1.6 million km warranties become standard, cheaper to keep than to repair  |
| 2035  | **$25**        | The battery pack literally costs less than the steel body it’s attached to   |
| 2045  | **<$20**       | Solar paint, structural batteries, energy-harvesting roads go mainstream     |

### Why gasoline got absolutely executed

- **Cheaper**: Right now in Norway electricity is already 1/6th the cost per km. By 2030 even in Texas an EV will cost half as much to “fuel.”
- **Faster**: 800 V platforms already do 350 kW → 400+ km in 10 minutes. Megawatt charging (1.5–2 MW) hits the grid 2027–2028.
- **More convenient**: No more gas-station stops. You charge at home, at work, at IKEA—while living your life.
- **Silent, buttery smooth, basically zero maintenance** (no oil, no gearbox, no exhaust, no turbo lag, no drama).

The wildest part?  
Most people still think this is a “save the planet” story.  
It’s not.  
It’s a cold-blooded economic execution.  
The planet just gets to dance on the grave.

The war is already over.  
We’re just waiting for the last dusty gas station sign to stop flickering and go dark forever.
