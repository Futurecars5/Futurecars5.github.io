# 02. Electric Revolution: The Day Gasoline Lost Forever (2025–2045)

By **2030**, **70 % of all new cars sold globally** will be fully electric.  
By **2045**, the internal-combustion engine will be banned in every developed market.

This is already law in the EU, Norway, UK, California, and China’s biggest provinces.

Gasoline didn’t lose because it was dirty.  
It lost because electricity became **cheaper, faster, and more convenient**.

The revolution is already over.  
We’re just waiting for the last gas station to turn off the lights.
