# 01. Introduction: The Biggest Automotive Revolution in History (2025–2045)

From 2025 to 2045, the car will change more than in the previous 140 years combined.

By 2035 **99 % of new cars sold globally** will be fully electric.  
By 2045 **70 % of all vehicles on the road** will drive themselves, **100 %** will be connected, and **zero** will end up in landfills.

These are not guesses — they are locked into EU law, Toyota/Tesla/Waymo roadmaps, and trillions of dollars already invested.

### Why everything is changing right now
Three irreversible forces just collided:
- Battery cost crashed from $1,200/kWh to **$58/kWh** and heading to $30
- AI already drives 10× safer than humans
- $1.7 trillion in global subsidies and ICE bans

### What you’ll see by 2030
- Family sedans with 600 km range + 300 km in 8 minutes
- Robotaxis in 100 cities at $0.30/km
- Interiors from ocean plastic and mushroom leather
- Cars that get better every night like an iPhone

### What 2045 looks like
- No steering wheel, pedals, or mirrors
- Bodies that morph for city or highway
- Roads that charge you while you drive
- Cities without parking lots — only parks
